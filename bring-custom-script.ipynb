    "# TensorFlow script mode training and serving\n",
    "Script mode is a training script format for TensorFlow that lets you execute any TensorFlow training script in SageMaker with minimal modification. The [SageMaker Python SDK](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk) handles transferring your script to a SageMaker training instance. On the training instance, SageMaker's native TensorFlow support sets up training-related environment variables and executes your training script. In this tutorial, we use the SageMaker Python SDK to launch a training job and deploy the trained model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Script mode supports training with a Python script, a Python module, or a shell script. In this example, we use a Python script to train a classification model on the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). In this example, we will show how easily you can train a SageMaker using TensorFlow 1.x and TensorFlow 2.0 scripts with SageMaker Python SDK. In addition, this notebook demonstrates how to perform real time inference with the [SageMaker TensorFlow Serving container](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-tensorflow-serving-container). The TensorFlow Serving container is the default inference method for script mode. For full documentation on the TensorFlow Serving container, please visit [here](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/blob/master/src/sagemaker/tensorflow/deploying_tensorflow_serving.rst)."

    "This tutorial's training script was adapted from TensorFlow's official [CNN MNIST example](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/tutorials/layers/cnn_mnist.py). We have modified it to handle the `model_dir` parameter passed in by SageMaker. This is an S3 path which can be used for data sharing during distributed training and checkpointing and/or model persistence. We have also added an argument-parsing function to handle processing training-related variables.\n",

    "`py_version` is set to `'py3'` to indicate that we are using script mode since legacy mode supports only Python 2. Though Python 2 will be deprecated soon, you can use script mode with Python 2 by setting py_version to `py2` and `script_mode` to True.\n",

Here we are using parameter servers as the distributed training schema. SageMaker training jobs run on homogeneous clusters. To make parameter server more performant in the SageMaker setup, we run a parameter server on every instance in the cluster, so there is no need to specify the number of parameter servers to launch. Script mode also supports distributed training with [Horovod](https://github.com/horovod/horovod). You can find the full documentation on how to configure distributions [here](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-python-sdk/tree/master/src/sagemaker/tensorflow#distributed-training)."
